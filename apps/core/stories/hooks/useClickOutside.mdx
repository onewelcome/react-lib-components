# useClickOutside

This hook is especially built for components or features that need to execute an action whenever the user clicks somewhere on the webpage outside of some specific element.
An example is a modal window that is open. If you click next to the modal window (on the content **behind** the modal), it usually indicates that you want to close the modal.
In order to do this, you can use the `useClickOutside` hook to quickly and efficiently apply an event listener to the body to check for this event.

## Arguments

The `useClickOutside` function accepts three arguments, first two mandatory (\*):

- `myElementRef` (\*) - the element outside of which we detect clicking
- `onClickOutside` (\*) - callback function called when click outside of the element occurs
  This function is entirely up to you. In our modal example, it is probably as some sort of `open` property that is set to `true` or `false` to indicate that the modal needs to be shown or not.
  The callback function in our case could be to set the state variable linked to the `open` property to `false`.
- dependencies - Whenever our component gets rendered and rerendered, we want to prevent that our internal mouse event listener gets added and removed too many times. It's the same as `useEffect`s dependency list. For example, when you use this hook to close a modal dialog, you would specify `[open]` with `open` being a state variable indicating whether the modal is open or not.

## Complete example

The following example shows behavior of the hook:

- when you click button1, its counter increases
- when you click outside both button1 and button 2, the "outside" counter increases
- when you click button2, both its counter and the "outside" counter increases

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [button1ClickCount, setButton1ClickCount] = useState(0);
  const [button2ClickCount, setButton2ClickCount] = useState(0);
  const [outsideButton1ClickCount, setOutsideButton1ClickCount] = useState(0);

  const myElementRef = useRef < HTMLButtonElement > null;

  useClickOutside(myElementRef, () => {
    setOutsideButton1ClickCount(outsideButton1ClickCount + 1);
  });

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Button
        ref={myElementRef}
        data-testid="button1"
        onClick={() => setButton1ClickCount(button1ClickCount + 1)}
      >
        button1 clicked {button1ClickCount} times
      </Button>
      <Button data-testid="button2" onClick={() => setButton2ClickCount(button2ClickCount + 1)}>
        button2 clicked {button2ClickCount} times
      </Button>
      outside of button1 clicked {outsideButton1ClickCount} times
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```
