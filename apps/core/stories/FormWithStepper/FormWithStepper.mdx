The `FormWithStepper` component will be used as a wrapper component that contains FormHeader, FormStepper or Stepper and form. Its root element is the default HTML `div` tag and thus also accepts all of its HTML attributes. You should use this component whenever you want to create a `FormWithStepper`.

# Example

<Canvas of={FormWithStepperStories.FormWithStepperComponent} />

# Props

<ArgTypes />
