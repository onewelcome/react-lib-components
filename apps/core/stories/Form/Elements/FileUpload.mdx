The `FileUpload` widget can be used to import data, images, certificates, etc. It depends on the use case whether a single file or multiple files can be uploaded.
The text and button in differ for a single or multiple files.
Uploading a new file replaces the existing one if only a single file is allowed.
Uploading a new file appends it to the existing list if multiple files are allowed for the field.
When possible, the native upload dialog should restrict the file types that can be uploaded.
For example, when only images are allowed, the native upload dialog should only allow image files.
When only a single file is allowed, the native upload dialog should allow one file only.
Drag and drop uploading is supported. When the user drags a file on the drop area, the background changes.
Showing a preview of fileâ€™s contents is currently out of scope, but may be introduced when needed.
For example, to show the image that is uploaded.

The properties the component receives are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>accept</strong>: It requires a string representing a list of file extensions separated
    by comma
  </li>

`File Upload` can be used as a simple file selector.
In this case, the component will receive all the state changes and progress of the files uploads from the client applications

<Subheading>useUploadFile hook</Subheading>A custom hook has been created in order to be used along
side the `FileUpload` component, in order to perform the upload action with ease The hook will
perform upload of each file from the fileList data array, provided they do not have a 'status'
property set up yet

The hook receives the following params:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>`files`</strong>: list of of selected files for the file upload component
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>`request`</strong>: an Object of type UploadFileRequestParams, which can contain:
    <ol>
      <li>`url`: the api url the http request will be made to</li>
      <li>`headers`: custom headers to be applied to the request</li>
      <li>`responseErrorPath`: a path by which to look for the error text of a response</li>
      <li>`networkErrorText`: in case a network error occurs, override the default error text</li>
      <li>`withCredentials`: setup with credentials request header</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>callbacks</strong>: an object of type: `UseUploadFileCallback` referencing two types of
    callbacks that can be used to along side the hook actions, on different request moments:
    <ol>
      <li>onComplete: Will be called when the request has readyState status of 'DONE'.</li>
      <li>onProgress: Will be called every time the on xhr progress event is fired</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

The hook will return a list of updated files and a list of files for which the call is ongoing.
Each of the updated file will contain a status value and sometimes an error text
While performing the HTTP call, the hook will update the ongoing files status property with a value of `uploading`
It will also update the file to contain metrics of their upload progress.

When the 'DONE' state of the HTTP call will be registered, the files will be updated to a status value corresponding to the network or server values.
For uploads completed successfully (status codes 200+), the status of a file will become `completed`.
For network errors, the status will have the value `retry`
For server errors, starting from status codes 400 and going over 500+, the status will be error;

The hook performs XHR calls and the payload will be of type formData, with two fields: `file`, containing the file data
and `name`, containing the file name
