import { ArgTypes, Canvas, Meta, Story, Subtitle, Title } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as DatePickerStories from "./DatePicker.stories.tsx";

<Meta of={DatePickerStories} />
<Title />
<Subtitle />

The DatePicker component is a flexible, easy-to-use date selection tool that provides users with an intuitive interface to choose dates.
It is based on the [react-day-picker](https://daypicker.dev/).

<Canvas of={DatePickerStories.DatePicker} />

# Example

```tsx
import { Fragment, useState } from "react";
import { DatePicker } from "./DatePicker";

const YourComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState<Date>();

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <DatePicker value={inputValue} onSelect={setInputValue} locale="enGB"></DatePicker>
      <p>{inputValue && inputValue.toDateString()}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```

# Features

Currently, we support `single` and `range` selection modes with a set of limited, fixed options.

It's possible to pass `locale` key. This way you can have the DatePicker translated and its style will match the standard look'n'feel for the given country code.
Internally, the calendar uses `date-fns/locale` package.

You can pass properties down to the original DayPicker component, however, you do it on your own risk and there is no guarantee it will work / look properly.

We utilize [custom class names feature](https://daypicker.dev/docs/styling#custom-class-names) to keep the consistency and all the benefits or css modules. Because of that it is difficult to override the default plugin styles.
