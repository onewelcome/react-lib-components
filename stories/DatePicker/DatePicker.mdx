import { ArgTypes, Canvas, Meta, Story, Subtitle, Title } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as DatePickerStories from "./DatePicker.stories.tsx";

<Meta of={DatePickerStories} />
<Title />
<Subtitle />

The DatePicker component is a flexible, easy-to-use date selection tool that provides users with an intuitive interface to choose dates.
It is based on the [react-day-picker](https://daypicker.dev/).

<Canvas>
  <Story of={DatePickerStories.DatePicker} />
</Canvas>

# Example

```tsx
import { Fragment, useState } from "react";
import { DatePicker } from "./DatePicker";

const YourComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState<Date>();

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <DatePicker value={inputValue} onSelect={setInputValue}></DatePicker>
      <p>{inputValue && inputValue.toDateString()}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```

# Features

Currently, we support only a `single` selection mode with a set of limited, fixed options. However, you can pass additional props directly to the underlying `DayPicker` component, giving you access to its full range of features.
Please note that when using these extended features, our custom styles will _not_ automatically apply, so you may need to add your own styles for consistency.

We utilize [custom class names feature](https://daypicker.dev/docs/styling#custom-class-names) to keep the consistency and all the benefits or css modules.
