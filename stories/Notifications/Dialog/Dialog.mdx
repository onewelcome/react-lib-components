Dialogs are used when immediate user interaction is required.
They block interaction with the application until a user has made a choice.
Dialogs appear as a modal on top of the existing content.

When the user presses enter without tabbing through the interface, the primary button is triggered, even when it is a destructive action.
There is no X (close) button, no event handler for the escape key and the dialog stays open when you click outside the dialog.

# Examples

The use of dialogues is very broad. See example usage below.

_Note: triggering primary button on pressing enter doesn't work in documentation section (Enter key is intercepted)._

## Action dialog

In the below code snippet, you'll see how you can show dialog with buttons align to right.

```jsx
<Dialog
  open={open}
  onClose={onClose}
  alignActions="right"
  title="Verify email address"
  primaryAction={label: 'Send email', onClick: onSendEmail}
  secondaryAction={label: 'Cancel', onClick: onCancel}
>
  <Fragment>
    <Typography variant="body">
      You want to verify the email address <b>dana.george@mydomain.com</b>.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0 }}>
      <b>Dana George</b> will receive an email with a verification link and must click the link to
      complete the verification.
    </Typography>
  </Fragment>
</Dialog>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-feedback-dialog--right-aligned-action-dialog" />
</Canvas>

## Destructive operation

In case of a destructive operation, the buttons align to the left instead of the right. This is to let users deliberately perform this destructive action.

In the below code snippet, you'll see how you can show dialog with buttons align to left.

```jsx
<Dialog
  open={open}
  onClose={onClose}
  alignActions="left"
  title="Discard changes?"
  primaryAction={label: 'Discard', onClick: onDiscard}
  secondaryAction={label: 'Keep editing', onClick: onKeepEditing}
>
  <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0 }}>
    This cannot be undone and you will lose your changes.
  </Typography>
</Dialog>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-feedback-dialog--left-aligned-action-dialog" />
</Canvas>

## Single action

In the below code snippet, you'll see how you can show dialog with on one button

```jsx
<Dialog
  open={open}
  onClose={onClose}
  alignActions="right"
  title="Info"
  primaryAction={label: 'Ok', onClick}
>
  <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0 }}>
    You can't remove your account.
  </Typography>
</Dialog>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-feedback-dialog--single-action-dialog" />
</Canvas>

## Nesting dialogs

In the below code snippet, you'll see how you can nest dialogs

```jsx
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
const [open2, setOpen2] = useState(false);
return (
  <Fragment>
    <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open dialog</Button>
    <Dialog
      open={open}
      alignActions="right"
      title="Dialog 1"
      onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
      primaryAction={{
        label: "Open another dialog",
        onClick: () => setOpen2(true)
      }}
      secondaryAction={{
        label: "Close",
        onClick: () => setOpen(false)
      }}
    >
      <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0 }}>
        Long dialog content. Long dialog content. Long dialog content. Long dialog content. Long
        dialog content.
      </Typography>
    </Dialog>
    <Dialog
      open={open2}
      onClose={() => setOpen2(false)}
      alignActions="left"
      title="Dialog 2"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "Close",
        onClick: () => setOpen2(false)
      }}
    >
      <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0 }}>
        Short dialog content.
      </Typography>
    </Dialog>
  </Fragment>
);
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-feedback-dialog--nested-dialogs" />
</Canvas>
