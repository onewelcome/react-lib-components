SideSheet is an extension of the basic `Modal` component. `SideSheet` can be used to display additional information without interrupting user flow. It takes all of the `Modal` component props with the addition of `handleProps` which can be used to configure the `SideSheet` handle button. It consists of:

- `onOpen` - callback that should be called when `SideSheet` opens
- `onClose` - callback that should be called when `SideSheet` closes
- `title` - accessible handle button name

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SideSheetStories.SideSheet} />
</Canvas>
