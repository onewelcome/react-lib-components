# Alert component

The `Alert` components and hook are there for you to make it easy to notify a user. You have the option of displaying an error, success or information `alert`. In order to use all of these different `Alert`s, you'll have to wrap your entire application
in the `AlertProvider` component. This will enable to `Alert` component to be portaled and displayed in the top levels of the DOM.

Once you've wrapped your application with the `AlertProvider` component, you are free to use the `useAlert` hook to create any `Alert` you like. This hook does **not** accept any arguments, but it returns 4 different functions.

The following functions will all accept an object when called, which looks as follows:

```js
{
  title?: string;
  content?: string;
  actions?: (ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & { label: string })[];
  className?: string;
  variant?: "info" | "success" | "error" | "warning";
  duration?: number;
  onClose?: () => void;
}
```

## Properties

The `title` is displayed at the top of the alert. The `content` is displayed inside of the alert.
If no `content` is provided, the `title` will be displayed in place of the content to ensure correct usage of the alert component.

The `actions` parameter might seem confusing, but this is simply an array of `Button` props. In the example down below, the "Show long alert" has this `actions` prop filled to make it more clear as to how this would look like.

The `className` adds the provided CSS class to Alert Item components.

An additional callback for closing the alert can be provided via the `onClose` property. It is called when the alert is closed automatically or manually by clicking the close button.

By default, the `duration` property is set to `4000` (4 seconds), except for the error variant Alert, where the `duration` is `8000` (8 seconds). You can increase or decrease this as you like.

## Methods

`useAlert` hook returns following methods:

### `enqueueAlert`

This function will allow you to create a regular info `Alert`. You could use the `variant` prop to specify a variant, but using `enqueueSuccessAlert`, `enqueueWarningAlert` or `enqueueErrorAlert` is an easier way of doing this.

### `enqueueErrorAlert`

It will allow you to easily and quickly create an error `Alert`. The `variant` prop is already set to be `error`.

### `enqueueSuccessAlert`

Creates a success alert with the `variant` prop already set to `success`.

### `enqueueWarningAlert`

Creates a warning alert with the `variant` prop already set to `warning`.

# Examples

First, wrap your entire application inside the `AlertProvider` component.

```jsx
<AlertProvider>
  <AppContent />
</AlertProvider>
```

Then use the `useAlert()` hook inside your application.

```jsx
const AppContent = () => {
  const { enqueueSuccessAlert, enqueueErrorAlert, enqueueWarningAlert, enqueueAlert } = useAlert();

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Button
        onClick={() =>
          enqueueSuccessAlert({
            content: "Main message of the alert",
            duration: 10000,
            onClose: () => console.log("onClose handler")
          })
        }
      >
        Show success alert
      </Button>
      <br />
      <br />
      <Button
        onClick={() =>
          enqueueErrorAlert({
            content: "Social account unlink failed",
            onClose: () => console.log("onClose handler")
          })
        }
      >
        Show error alert
      </Button>
      <br />
      <br />
      <Button
        onClick={() =>
          enqueueAlert({
            content: "Copy of your data is requested",
            onClose: () => console.log("onClose handler")
          })
        }
      >
        Show info alert
      </Button>
      <br />
      <br />
      <Button
        onClick={() =>
          enqueueWarningAlert({ content: "You request is being processed with a delay" })
        }
      >
        Show warning alert
      </Button>
      <br />
      <br />
      <Button
        onClick={() =>
          enqueueAlert({
            title: "Copy of your data is requested",
            content:
              "Body text of the alert. Keep it short. Users only have a few seconds to read it. Try to keep the text within the limit of 1 text message: 160 ch.",
            actions: [
              { label: "Contact support", onClick: () => alert("Clicked support") },
              { label: "Contact OneWelcome", onClick: () => alert("Clicked OneWelcome") }
            ]
          })
        }
      >
        Show long alert
      </Button>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```
