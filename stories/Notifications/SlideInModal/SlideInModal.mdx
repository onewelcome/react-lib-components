SlideInModal is an extension of the basic `Modal` component. The only difference between two is a purely visual one: `SlideInModal` slides into the right side of viewport, and has no visible backdrop.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-notifications-slideinmodal--slide-in-modal" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
