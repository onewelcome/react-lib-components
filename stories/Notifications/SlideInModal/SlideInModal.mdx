<Title />
<Subtitle />

SlideInModal is an extension of the basic `Modal` component. The only difference between these two is a purely visual one: `SlideInModal` slides into the right side of viewport, and has no visible backdrop.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SlideInModalStories.SlideInModal} />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
