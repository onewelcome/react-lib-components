Modals are used to present interactive or larger content - like the modal with the form. Modals contain:

- header: title, close button and additional content like wizard,
- content: what ever content to display,
- footer: containing action buttons to interact with content and modal.

Modals appear as a modal on top of the existing content.

## Cancel button configuration

Enhance your modal with a left-aligned cancel button by simply applying the `cancelAction` property, complete with a required `label` field.

Customization is possible by adding extra properties to the `cancelAction` configuration, allowing adjustments to the button's visual style.

The Modal's `onClose` method is attached to cancel button's `onClick` event.

Unlike the `<Dialog />` component, where the `cancelButton` remains visible even on mobile resolutions,
in the `<Modal />` component, the `cancelButton` **is hidden on smaller screens to preserve readability**.
Modal closure can be accomplished by pressing the `Esc` key or by clicking outside the modal.

# Examples

In the below code snippet, you'll see how you can create a `Modal` with simple form.

```jsx
<Modal id="modal" open={open} onClose={onClose}>
  <ModalHeader id="modal-label" title="Modal title" />
  <ModalContent id="modal-description">
    <form id="modalForm">
      <Typography variant="body" spacing={{ margin: 0, padding: "0 5 5" }}>
        This is simple modal.
      </Typography>
      <FormControl>
        <InputWrapper
          helperText="Helper text for this field. Description should be short and not repeat the label"
          name="input1"
          type="text"
          value={value}
          error={false}
          label="Name"
          onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}
        />
      </FormControl>
    </form>
  </ModalContent>
  <ModalActions cancelAction={{ label: "Cancel" }}>
    <Button variant="text" onClick={onExampleClick}>
      Example
    </Button>
    <Button form="modalForm" type="submit">
      Save
    </Button>
  </ModalActions>
</Modal>
```

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Modal} />
