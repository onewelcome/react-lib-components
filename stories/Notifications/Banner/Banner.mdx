`Banners` are used to warn or inform the user about existing state of the application without blocking further interaction.
Banners appear close to where user action is expected as inline block.

Variants:

- Informational: the user does not need to perform an action. For example, upcoming maintenance.
- Warning: the user must perform an action, but not necessarily at this moment.
  Another usage is to indicate deprecated configuration or a discouraged setting for a production environment.
- Error: the user cannot continue.
  Either the user must take immediate action, or there is something really wrong with the system.

The `Banner` story you see bellow can be controlled using the Props bellow. The Aria props are added for accessibility

<DocsStory id="components-feedback-banner--info-banner" />
