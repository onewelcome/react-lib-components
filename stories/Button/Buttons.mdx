The button component is used all throughout the component library. There's two different kinds of buttons and they both extend our `BaseButton` component. The two kinds are:

- `Button` component
- `IconButton` component

The `Button` component is used to display a button with a label and an optional icon at the start or end.

The `IconButton` component is used to display a button with only an icon, no visible label.

`Button` and `IconButton` are used to perform certain actions. These actions should **not** be a route change or a `link` to somewhere. It should trigger a change on the page itself such as opening a modal or submitting a `Form`.
