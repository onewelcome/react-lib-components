<Title />
<Subtitle />

The `IconButton` is used to display a button with only an icon, no visible label. However, there is a `title` prop that is mandatory to fill in for accessibility. This way screenreaders know what the `IconButton` is for.

An example reason of using an `IconButton` instead of a regular `Button` component is when combining it with a `ContextMenu` component. For this, you can see the [Tiles component](/story/stories-ui-tiles--tiles). The `IconButton` is used in the top right of every tile
in order to display a `ContextMenu`.

# Examples

```jsx
<IconButton title="Open calendar" color="primary">
  <Icon icon={Icons.Calendar} />
</IconButton>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-iconbutton--icon-button" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
