The button component is used all throughout the component library and it extends the `BaseButton` component.

The `Button` component is used to display a button with a label and an optional icon at the start or end.

`Button` and `IconButton` are used to perform certain actions. These actions should **not** be a route change or a `link` to somewhere. It should trigger a change on the page itself such as opening a modal or submitting a `Form`.

# Examples

In the below code snippet you'll see how you can create the buttons displayed down below.

```jsx
<Button title="This is a button">
  This is a button
</Button>

<Button title="This is a button" variant="outline">
  This is a button
</Button>

<Button title="This is a button" variant="text" startIcon={<Icon icon={Icons.Calendar} />}>
  This is a button
</Button>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-button--filled-button" />
  <Story id="stories-ui-button--outline-button" />
  <Story id="stories-ui-button--start-icon-button" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
