The `Button` component is used to display a button with a label and an optional icon at the start or end.

`Button` and `IconButton` are used to perform certain actions. These actions should **not** be a route change or a `link` to somewhere. It should trigger a change on the page itself such as opening a modal or submitting a `Form`.

# Examples

In the below code snippet you'll see how you can create the buttons displayed down below.

```jsx
<Button>
  This is a button
</Button>

<Button variant="outline">
  This is a button
</Button>

<Button variant="text">
  This is a button
</Button>

<Button variant="filled" startIcon={<Icon icon={Icons.Calendar} />}>
  This is a button
</Button>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.FilledButton} />
  <Story of={ButtonStories.OutlineButton} />
  <Story of={ButtonStories.TextButton} />
  <Story of={ButtonStories.StartIconButton} />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
