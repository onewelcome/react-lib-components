The Tooltip component provides contextual information to users about specific interface elements. It serves as an accessibility and UX enhancement by displaying relevant details about other components.

## Composing

Define a `label` prop to show content to which tooltip will be appended. Label can be either a string that will be rendered as a text alongside with an info icon <Icon icon={Icons.InfoCircle} /> or a React component to which the tooltip will be attached to.

The `children` prop can also be either a simple string or a ReactNode, allowing for formatted content or custom ui element within the tooltip.

## Positioning

Tooltip placement is controlled through two primary properties: `location` and `position`. These properties work in conjunction to determine the tooltip's final position relative to its target element.

The `location` property specifies the primary placement direction relative to the target element:

- `top` - Positions the tooltip above the target element
- `bottom` - Positions the tooltip below the target element
- `left` - Positions the tooltip to the left of the target element
- `right` - Positions the tooltip to the right of the target element

The `position` property defines the alignment along the chosen location:

- `start` - Aligns to the leading edge (top for horizontal locations, left for vertical locations)
- `center` - Centers the tooltip relative to the target element
- `end` - Aligns to the trailing edge (bottom for horizontal locations, right for vertical locations)

For example, location="top" with position="center" places the tooltip above the target element with horizontal centering, while location="top" with position="start" places it above the target element aligned to the left edge.

# Examples

## With text label

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.SimpleTooltip} />

## With formatted content

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.WithFormattedContent} />

## Attached to React component

The tooltip can use a React component as its label. This allows user to attach a tooltip to a more complex UI element.

<Canvas of={TooltipStories.WithReactComponentLabel} />
