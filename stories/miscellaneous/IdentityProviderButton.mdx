The `<IdentityProviderButton/>` component is a special variant of `<Button/>`. It was created to simplify adding Identity Provider
buttons. It's designed to be used in conjunction with `react-lib-components-theme-adapter` that is capable of generating a full
customization palette for a specific IdP type.

When `iconUrl` is not provided, the component automatically fallbacks to a default one that is set up in `theme-common-content-service`.
For this to work the correct `idpType` must be passed. It's currently a simple string to avoid extra work when adding new IdP types.

## Why not reuse Button?

Buttons API is slightly different. It allows the use of only a predefined list of icons where we need to support passing a URL to the icon resource.
