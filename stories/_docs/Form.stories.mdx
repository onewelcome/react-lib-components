# Form

The `Form` component will be used as a wrapper component for all of the form elements. Its root element is the default HTML `form` tag and thus also accepts all of it's HTML attributes. You should use this component whenever you want to create a `form`.

## Examples

Examples of the Form component can be found in it's [respective story](/docs/stories-form-form--form-el)

## Props

Below you will find all of the props of the components. If you need information on what types are specific to React [click here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/advanced/types_react_api/#typesreact). Prop names with a `?` are optional. Keep in mind that `...rest` is passed down through most components. Note that all of our components accept the `className` prop.

| Prop name | Type                                                                                   | Default   | Description                                   |
