The `Stepper` component is used to keep user informed about their progress in a multi-step process. It indicates what step they are on, what has been accomplished, what hasn't and where mistakes were made.

It has the following props:

```tsx
steps: StepProps[];
direction: "horizontal" | "vertical";
```

### `steps`

This prop allows user to specify the array of `Steps`:

```tsx
status: StepStatus;
label: string;
caption?: string;
index?: number;
disabled?: boolean;
direction?: "horizontal" | "vertical";
```

Each step must have a `label`, the `caption` is optional. User can specify the state of each step using the `status` prop. This interface extends the `ComponentPropsWithRef<"button">` interface which means that user can specify every `button` prop (such as `onClick`, `onBlur` etc.).

### `direction`

The stepper can be used both veritcally and horizontally. The default value of this props is `horizontal`

## Examples

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Stepper, StepperProps } from "@onewelcome/react-lib-components";

const stepperProps: StepperProps = {
  direction: "vertical",
  steps: [
    {
      id: "hover",
      label: "Step 1",
      status: "waiting",
      caption: "Caption"
    },
    {
      id: "active",
      label: "Step 2",
      status: "waiting",
      caption: "Caption"
    },
    {
      id: "focus",
      label: "Step 3",
      status: "waiting",
      caption: "Caption"
    },
    {
      id: "disabled",
      label: "Step 4",
      status: "waiting",
      caption: "Caption"
    }
  ]
};

  return <Stepper {...stepperProps} />;
};
