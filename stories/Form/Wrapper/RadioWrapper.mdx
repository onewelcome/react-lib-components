The `RadioWrapper` component has been created to make your life easier, as well as make sure that accessibility is taken care of in a proper way. It requires you to pass at least four props: a `name`, `fieldsetProps.legend`, `value` and an `onChange`.

The `value` prop should be linked to a React `state`, and the `onChange` prop should set this `state` to the `event.target.value` it receives. You can set the initially checked radio if you set the `state` to the `value` of the `Radio` component you want to be checked.

As the name implies, the `RadioWrapper` component should be used as a wrapper around your `Radio` components. It has a few functions that help you with retaining proper accessibility and functionality:

## It adds a Fieldset component

And this `Fieldset` component requires a `legend` prop, which increases accessibility by telling screenreaders what your `Radio` component is used for. You will also have access to the rest of the `Fieldset` props through the `fieldsetProps` prop on the `RadioWrapper` component. For all of the props [see the `Fieldset` component documentation](/docs/stories-form-elements-fieldset--fieldset).

## It enables proper accessibility features

The `RadioWrapper` component has an internal ID for its helper text and error message. The children `Radio` components will be linked to this helper text and error message through the `aria-describedby` accessibility feature automatically if needed. This works as follows: if a nested `Radio` component has a helper text, the id of this helper text will be its `aria-describedby` value. In case the `Radio` component does **not** have a helper text, the `aria-describedby` value will be the ID of the helper text that its parent `RadioWrapper` component has. Whenever the `RadioWrapper` has an error, and the `errorMessage` prop is filled, the `aria-describedby` attribute of all child `Radio` components will be the ID of this `errorMessage`.

You will not have to do anything about these complicated accessibility features. It's all done internally for you.

## It gives styling on error or disabled

The disabled state for all `Radio` components within the `RadioWrapper` can be controlled through the `disabled` prop on `RadioWrapper`. The same goes for the `error` prop.

## Custom helper text and error message

You can compose both helper text and error message out of any components you'd like. Keep in mind you will need to handle the proper styling of those custom elements. All you need to do is to pass the `children` to `helperProps` for custom `helperText`
or `error` set to `true` along with `children` in `errorMessageProps` for custom error message.

# Examples

A code example of how you can configure a `RadioWrapper` within a React component:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [radioValue, setRadioValue] = useState("option1");

  return (
    <RadioWrapper
      name="radio group 1"
      fieldsetProps={{ legend: "Radio group" }}
      value={radioValue}
      onChange={event => setRadioValue(event.target.value)}
    >
      <Radio value="option1">Option 1</Radio>
      <Radio value="option2">Option 2</Radio>
      <Radio value="option3">Option 3</Radio>
      <Radio value="option4">Option 4</Radio>
    </RadioWrapper>
  );
};
```

The story below is controlled by Storybook. You can configure it using the [Props table](#props).
