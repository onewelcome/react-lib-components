<Title />
<Subtitle />

The `SelectWrapper` component has been created to make your life easier as well as make sure that accessibility is taken care of in a proper way. It requires you to pass at least 3 attributes. It needs `children` (which have to be `Option` components), a `name` and a `value` prop, which should be linked to a `useState` variable.
