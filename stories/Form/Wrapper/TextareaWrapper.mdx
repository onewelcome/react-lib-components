The `TextareaWrapper` component has been created to make your life easier as well as make sure that accessibility is taken care of in a proper way. It requires you to pass at least 2 attributes. It needs a `name` and a `value` (which should be linked to a `useState` variable).

You can use the `onChange` event to update the linked `useState` variable whenever the user types something inside of the rendered `textarea`.

## It takes care of proper accessibility

The `TextareaWrapper` accepts a `name`, `helperText` and `errorMessage` prop. Based on the `error` prop (set to true or false) it will make sure to set its `aria-describedby` value to the `id` of the `errorMessage` or `helperText`.

## Customize `textarea` HTML element

You can change anything pertaining to the `textarea` element that's rendered by passing a configuration object to `textareaProps`. An example is shown below.

## Custom helper text and error message

You can compose both helper text and error message out of any components you'd like. Keep in mind you will need to handle the proper styling of those custom elements. All you need to do is to pass the `children` to `helperProps` for custom `helperText`
or `error` set to `true` along with `children` in `errorMessageProps` for custom error message.

# Examples

A code example of how you can configure a `TextareaWrapper` within a React component:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [textareaValue, setTextareaValue] = useState("");

  return (
    <TextareaWrapper
      label="Example textarea"
      name="Textarea"
      helperText="Example textarea helpertext"
      errorMessage="Textarea error message"
      onChange={e => setTextareaValue(e.target.value)}
      textareaProps={{
        rows: 50
      }}
      error={error}
      value={textareaValue}
    />
  );
};
```
