The `InputWrapper` component has been created to make your life easier as well as make sure that accessibility is taken care of in a proper way. It requires you to pass at least 3 attributes. It needs `children` (which have to be `Option` components), a `name` and a `value` prop, which should be linked to a `useState` variable.

You can use the `onChange` event to update the linked `useState` variable whenever the user selects an option or uses the `onClear` event to clear the state completely.

## It takes care of proper accessibility

The `InputWrapper` accepts a `name`, `helperText` and `errorMessage` prop. Based on the `error` prop (set to true or false) it will make sure to set its `aria-describedby` value to the `id` of the `errorMessage` or `helperText`.

The `value` prop should be linked to a `useState` variable that gets updated using the `onChange` event.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-form-wrapper-InputWrapper--select-wrapper" />
</Canvas>

A code example of how you can configure a `InputWrapper` within a React component:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("")

  return (
    <InputWrapperComponent
      label="Example label"
      type="text"
      name="Example name"
      helperText="This is helpertext"
      onChange={() => {}}
      errorMessage="This is an error message"
      error={false}
      value=""
      inputProps= {
        prefix: "https://",
        suffix: "",
        className: "input-classname",
        wrapperProps: { className: "wrapper-classname" }
      }
    />
  );
};
```

# Props
