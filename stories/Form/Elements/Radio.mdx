The `Radio` component is a native HTML `input` element. And just like the native elements, it should be linked to a `form`. This can be done by either nesting the `Checkbox` component inside of a `Form` component, or by linking to a `form` element by using the appropriate `form` attribute.

For proper accessibility it is recommended to nest the `Radio` component inside a `Fieldset` component so it has a `legend` element that tells the end-user what they represent. [The `RadioWrapper` component already does this for you.](/docs/stories-form-wrapper-radiowrapper--radio-wrapper-el)

Each individual radio button can have their own `helperText` and `errorMessage`. By default, the `helperText` will be show **if** this prop is filled in. As soon as the `error` prop is set to `true`, the `errorMessage` will be shown.
