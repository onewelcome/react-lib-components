The FormHelperText component is mostly used within other components of the library. All of the different `wrapper`s make use of it.
It is also highly recommended to **not** use this component, unless you need high levels of customization. The `InputWrapper`, `SelectWrapper`, etc. all have proper accessibility features
that are linked to their helper texts (such as `aria-describedby`), which you will have to do by yourself should you decide to use `FormHelperText` and other form elements separately.

In edge cases, where you will have to create your own structure, please study the implementation of the different `wrapper`s that we've created to get proper accessibility support.

The `FormHelperText` component is not complicated, it only accepts `children` and an `error` prop, which is a boolean, that gives the `FormHelperText` a red error color instead of the default.

# Examples

<DocsStory id="stories-form-elements-formhelpertext--form-helper-text" />

```jsx
<FormHelperText error={false}>content</FormHelperText>
```

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
