The `FormControl` component is used to position form elements within a container. This is useful for when you want for example multiple `Input` fields next to each other (say a first name and last name). The maximum grid you can create is 3 and it's already responsive so you don't have to worry about mobile.

We also give you the option to vertically `align` the components you put inside of `FormControl`. This is done through the `align` prop. See the examples and `Props` table for the options.

# Examples

The `FormControl` story you see below can be controlled using the Props table at the bottom. You can select the grid you want and how to vertically align all elements.

<Canvas of={FormControlStories.FormControl} id="components-layout-formcontrol--form-control" />
