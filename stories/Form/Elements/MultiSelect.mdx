The `MultiSelect` component does **not** use the native HTML `select` element under the hood. Because of the design, we had to opt for a different variant. However, it still works as a `select` is intended to work.

This also means that not all native `select` HTML attributes are available.

Other than that, the `MultiSelect` component works as you would expect. It requires you to specify options by providing `MultiOption` components that accept a `value` prop. This `value` prop will be passed to the parent `MultiSelect` component. Whenever you click on an `MultiOption`, the `onChange` event will be fired on the parent `MultiSelect` component.

We automatically display a search ' Input ' field when you have a `MultiSelect` component. You don't need to do anything about this. In order to change the placeholder, you can use the `searchPlaceholder` prop on the `MultiSelect` component.
To turn off search pass `search` prop object with `enabled` property set to `false`.

# Features

## Search feature

See [`Select` components](?path=/docs/components-inputs-raw-select--docs#search-feature) for more information.

## Add new feature

See [`Select` components](?path=/docs/components-inputs-raw-select--docs#add-new-feature) for more information.

## Preselected (unremovable) options

Selected options are shown as [`Tag` components](?path=/docs/components-feedback-tag--docs). To deselect option just click on remove button inside tag with the value you want to deselect.
The `fixed` prop of `MultiOption` among with preselecting that option let you show selected option that can not be deselected. This can be used to show user that some options are preselected for chosen flow.

## Keyboard navigation

The `MultiSelect` component supports keyboard navigation and was prepared to speed up selecting of options.

- To enter dropdown list press `Enter` or `Space`;
- To navigate over list use `Arrow Up`, `Arrow Down`,`Home` and `End`;
- To search (if enabled) just type your query when dropdown list is expanded;
- To select press `Enter`;
- To close press `Escape`;
- To remove selected options use `Tab` and `Enter`;

# Examples

An example of how a `MultiSelect` component can be built using state looks as follows:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [pickedOptions, setPickedOptions] = useState<string[]>(["option1"]);
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);

  return (
    <MultiSelect
      name="Example select element"
            value={pickedOptions}
      onChange={event => {
        setPickedOptions(
          Array.from(event.target.options).filter(option => option.selected).map(option => option.value)
        );
      }}
      error={hasError}
    >
      <MultiOption value="option1" fixed>Option 1</MultiOption>
      <MultiOption value="option2">Option 2</MultiOption>
      <MultiOption value="option3">Option 3</MultiOption>
      <MultiOption value="option4">Option 4</MultiOption>
      <MultiOption value="option5">Option 5</MultiOption>
    </MultiSelect>
  );
};
```

The `onChange` method: if we click an `MultiOption` we receive the `event` object as a parameter in our function, which has `target` prop, which has a `options` prop. This `options` is an array contains all selected options from which you can filter out all selected values. You can see this if you go to [the Canvas tab](/story/components-feedback-tag--enabled-tag) and then click the `Actions` tab next to `Controls`. If you do not see this, press the `a` key on your keyboard. Then while on the `Actions` tab, select an option from the `Select` component in the `Canvas` and you'll see that the `onChange` function was fired. The very first object (index `0`) is the `event` object we send you. The second object we give you is the `React instance` of the `Option` component.

See below an example of a `MultiSelect` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={MultiSelectStories.MultiSelect} />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
