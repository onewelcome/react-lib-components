The `Select` component does **not** use the native HTML `select` element under the hood. Because of the design, we had to opt for a different variant. However, it still works as a `select` is intended to work.

This also means that not all native `select` HTML attributes are available. By far, the most important one we currently do not support is `multiple`.

Other than that, the `Select` component works as you would expect. It requires you to specify options by providing `Option` components that accept a `value` prop. This `value` prop will be passed to the parent `Select` component. Whenever you click on an `Option`, the `onChange` event will be fired on the parent `Select` component.

We automatically display a search ' Input ' field when you have a `Select` component with 10 or more options. You don't need to do anything about this. In order to change the placeholder, you can use the `searchPlaceholder` prop on the `Select` component.

# Examples

See below an example of a `Select` component. It is controlled by Storybook, and selecting a value will not do anything. However, you can change the value by selecting it in the [Props table](#props).

<DocsStory id="stories-form-elements-select--select" />

An example of how a `Select` component can be built using state looks as follows:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [selectValue, setSelectValue] = useState("");
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Select
      name="Example select element"
      onChange={event => setSelectValue(event.target.value)}
      value={selectValue}
      error={hasError}
    >
      <Option value="option1">Option 1</Option>
      <Option value="option2">Option 2</Option>
      <Option value="option3">Option 3</Option>
      <Option value="option4">Option 4</Option>
      <Option value="option5">Option 5</Option>
    </Select>
  );
};
```

The `onChange` method: if we click an `Option` we receive the `event` object as a parameter in our function, which has `target` prop, which has a `value` prop. This `value` corresponds to the `value` prop on the `Option` component that was clicked. You can see this if you go to [the Canvas tab](/story/stories-form-elements-select--select) and then click the `Actions` tab next to `Controls`. If you do not see this, press the `a` key on your keyboard. Then while on the `Actions` tab, select an option from the `Select` component in the `Canvas` and you'll see that the `onChange` function was fired. The very first object (index `0`) is the `event` object we send you. The second object we give you is the `React instance` of the `Option` component.
