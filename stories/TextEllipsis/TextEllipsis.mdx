The `TextEllipsis` component is used to shorten overflowing text and to display the full text in a popover component.

It accepts `children` which should contain a string, and a `popoverClassName` prop, which can be used to customise the popover's appearance.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-utils-textellipsis--text-ellipsis" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
