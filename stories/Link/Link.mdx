<Subtitle />

The `Link` component is used to display a link to both internal and external resources. Its target can be specified using the `to` prop. Styling of `Link` can be adjusted if needed - one can set its color using the `color` prop, or change its appearance altogether by setting the `display` prop to `"button"`.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LinkStories.Link} />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
