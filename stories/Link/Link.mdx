import { ArgTypes, Canvas, Meta, Story, Subtitle, Title } from "@storybook/blocks";

<Meta of={LinkStories} />
<Title />
<Subtitle />

The `Link` component is used to display a link to both internal and external resources. Its target can be specified using the `to` prop. Styling of `Link` can be adjusted if needed - one can set its color using the `color` prop, or change its appearance altogether by setting the `display` prop to `"button"`.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Link } from './Link';

// Normal Link
<Link to="https://example.com">External Link</Link>

// React Router Link
<Link to="/internal/page" component={RouterLink}>Internal Page</Link>
```

In the above examples, the first usage shows a regular hyperlink. The second usage demonstrates how to pass a RouterLink component (from react-router-dom) as a prop to our custom Link component, making it work as a React Router Link.

This example assumes you're wrapping your application with BrowserRouter or MemoryRouter from react-router-dom at a higher level in your app. If not, make sure to wrap these components with either BrowserRouter or MemoryRouter:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import { Link as RouterLink } from "react-router-dom";
import { Link } from "./Link";

// In your App component or any component that is a common parent of these Links
<Router>
  <Link to="https://example.com">External Link</Link>
  <Link to="/internal/page" component={RouterLink}>
    Internal Page
  </Link>
</Router>;
```

By doing this you ensure that the Link component has access to the Router context and works as expected when clicked on.

  <Story of={LinkStories.Link} />
