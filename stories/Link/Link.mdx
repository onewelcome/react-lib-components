<Title />
<Subtitle />

The `Link` component is used to display a link to both internal and external resources. It's target can be specified using the `to` prop. Styling of `Link` can be adjusted if needed - one can set it's color using the `color` prop, or change it's appearance altogether by setting the `display` prop to `"button"`.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-link--link" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
