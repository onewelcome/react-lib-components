The `useRepeater` hook is written to help duplicate one or a set of component(s). It can be helpful if a user can enter one or multiple entries of the same set of fields. If you plan to use this within a `form`, then first check if the Form Management Library you're using (`formik` or `React Final Forms`) has its own implementation of a repeater!

A practical example of this would be `Tags`, for example. Keywords that could be searched by a user to find the thing they're looking for.

The `useRepeater` hook only requires you to pass the React Component you want to repeat. This has to be a react component and has to be passed in its component form **not** as a reference (meaning `<Componentname />` and not `Componentname`). An advantage of this, is that you can immediately pass props to that component.

What `useRepeater` returns are three values:

- `repeat` function
- `remove` function
- `repeatedComponents` array of `JSX.Element`

## `repeat()`

The repeat function does what its name suggests, create another instance of your component. You can, for example, create your own `Button` component, which has an `onClick` listener that executes `repeat()` whenever it's clicked on. This will add another
instance of the component you want to repeat inside the `repeatedComponents` array.

## `remove(component: JSX.Element)`

The remove function also does what its name suggests, remove a component from the `repeatedComponents` array. It needs its first parameter to be a reference to the component you want to remove. If you map over the components inside the `repeatedComponents` array,
you can create a delete button and pass the reference to that component inside the `remove()` function.

## `repeatedComponents`

As mentioned before the `repeatedComponents` variable is an array which contains all of the repeated components which you can loop through, by means of your choice.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={useRepeaterStories.Repeater} />
</Canvas>

Example `ComponentToRepeat`:

```JSX

export interface RepeatedComponentProps {
  onChange?: (state: { [key: string]: unknown }) => void;
  identifier?: string;
}

const ComponentToRepeat = ({ onChange, identifier }: RepeatedComponentProps) => {
  const [inputState, setInputState] = useState({
    errorMessage: 'random error',
    error: false,
    value: '',
    identifier: identifier,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onChange(inputState);
  }, [inputState]);

  return (
    <InputWrapper
      helperText="Enter a tag"
      name={`input_${inputState.identifier}`}
      errorMessage={inputState.errorMessage}
      type="text"
      error={inputState.error}
      value={inputState.value}
      label="Enter tag name"
      onChange={(event) => {
        setInputState((prevState) => ({ ...prevState, value: event.target.value }));
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

As you can see in the `ComponentToRepeat` example above, we simply define an `onChange` function that we execute whenever the `inputState` changes. We also pass an `identifier` to the component so we can give the `InputWrapper` inside a unique `name` attribute (which will also be added as an `id`).

If you see the code example above the code snippet (click `Show code` in the lower right corner), you see that the `return` statement contains a loop in which we `map` over the `repeatedComponents` array that we get back from the `useRepeater` hook. Then, in order to add a unique `identifier` prop, we simply use `React.cloneElement` to clone the `component` we loop over and add an `identifier` prop with a unique value that we generate with the `generateID` function.

Now, whenever an `InputWrapper` component fires its `onChange` event, we get back that `inputState` that contains this `UID` and it's corresponding state. Make sure that the first element inside of your `map` function has a unique `key` property! If you loop over the `repeatedComponents` array, then each component has a unique `key` prop that you can use.
