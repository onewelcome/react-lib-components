# useBodyClick

This hook is especially built for components or features that need to execute an action whenever the user clicks somewhere on the webpage.
An example is a modal window that is open. If you click next to the modal window (on the content **behind** the modal), it usually indicates that you want to close the modal.
In order to do this, you can use the `useBodyClick` hook to quickly and efficiently apply an event listener to the body to check for this event.

## Arguments

The `useBodyClick` function accepts three arguments, the check function, the callback function, and the depending state variable.

### Check function

The check function is the function that will be executed every time the user clicks on the body. It should return a boolean value to indicate whether the callback function should be called.
It gives you the `event` object that you can work with in order to check things.

Coming back to our modal example, our check function could check whether the `event.target` that was clicked on was the modal or any of its children. If that's the case, we do not want
the modal to be closed, so our check function should return false. However, if it's not the case, the user clicks outside the modal, and we want to execute the callback function.

Example check function:

```js
const checkFunction = (event: MouseEvent) =>
  !event.target.classList.contains("modalclass") || !event.target.closest(".modalclass");
```

So we want to return true if the `event.target` does not have the `modalclass` or if any parent of `event.target` does not have the `modalclass`.

### Callback function

This function is entirely up to you. In our modal example, it is probably as some sort of `open` property that is set to `true` or `false` to indicate that the modal needs to be shown or not.
The callback function in our case could be to set the state variable linked to the `open` property to `false`.

Example callback function:

```js
setOpen(false);
```

### Statevariable

Whenever our component gets rendered and rerendered, we want to prevent that our `window.addEventListener` gets added more than once. After all,
if we add it more times that could lead to some massive issues. That's why we add a depending state variable that indicates when we
need to add or remove the event listener. In the case of our modal example, this is the `open` state. Think of it like a `useEffect`s dependency array.

## Complete example

If we put all of the examples together we would get something like this:

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  useBodyClick(
    (event: MouseEvent) =>
      (!event.target.classList.contains("modalclass") || !event.target.closest(".modalclass")) &&
      open,
    () => setOpen(false),
    open
  );

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Click me to open modal</Button>
      <Modal open={open}>{...children}</Modal>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```
