<Title />
<Subtitle />

The `Tiles` component has been created to display a single, or multiple, `Tile` components. It can, and should, be utilized as a wrapper to the `Tile` component to provide a proper pre-defined grid structure.
The maximum amount of `Tile` component next to each other is 3 on desktop and it scales down automatically when the window resizes to a smaller viewport.

At the same time it will provide you with the option to enable and disable a `loading` state which will show 3 `Tile` components with Skeleton Loading.

For documentation regarding individual `Tile` components, [see this page](?path=/docs/stories-ui-tiles-tile--tile).
