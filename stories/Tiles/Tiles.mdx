The `Tiles` component has been created to display a single or multiple `Tile` component. It can, and should, be utilized as a wrapper to the `Tile` component to provide a proper pre-defined grid structure.
The maximum number of `Tile` components next to each other is three on the desktop, which scales down automatically when the window resizes to a smaller viewport.

At the same time, it will allow you to enable and disable a `loading` state, showing 3 `Tile` components with Skeleton Loading.

For documentation regarding individual `Tile` components, [see this page](?path=/docs/stories-ui-tiles-tile--tile).
