The `Tile` component should always be nested in the `Tiles` component. It renders a container that stretches based on its parent. There are multiple things a `Tile` component can render for you:

## `title`

It tells screenreaders what the `Tile` is. So make it a description, for example, `OneWelcome Identity Provider`.

## `imageProps`

It is an object that accepts every single attribute for an `img` HTML element. The most important one here is the `src`, which should be a string linking to the image.

## `tileAction`

It should be a component that could trigger something. Think about an `IconButton` to add something to your favorites or a `ContextMenu` to display a list of items.

## `enabled`

The `enabled` prop has three states: `true`, `false`, and `undefined`. When it's set to `true`, a checkmark will be displayed in the top left corner, if it's `false`, it will be a forbidden icon, and `undefined` will not render anything.

## `loading`

This prop will be inherited from the `Tiles` wrapper component. But if you use `Tile` as an individual component, you can always manually set the `loading` state through this prop.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story of={TileStories.Tile} />
</Canvas>
