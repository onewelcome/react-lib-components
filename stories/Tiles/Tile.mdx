The `Tile` component should always be nested in the `Tiles` component. It renders a container that stretches based on its parent. There are multiple things a `Tile` component can render for you:

## Enabled

The `enabled` prop has three states: `true`, `false`, and `undefined`. Then it's set to `true`, a checkmark will be displayed in the top left corner, if it's `false` it will be a forbidden icon

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-tiles-tile--tile" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
