<Subtitle />

The `Tile` component should always be nested in the `Tiles` component. It renders a container that stretches based on its parent. There are multiple things a `Tile` component can render for you:

## `title`

The only mandatory prop. This tells screenreaders what the `Tile` is. So make it a description, for example `OneWelcome Identity Provider`.

## `imageProps`

Is an object that accepts every single attribute for an `img` HTML element. Obviously the most important one here is the `src`, which should be a string linking to the image.

## `tileAction`

Should be a component that could trigger something. Think about an `IconButton` to add something to your favorites, or a `ContextMenu` to display a list of items.

## `enabled`

The `enabled` prop has three states: `true`, `false`, and `undefined`. When it's set to `true`, a checkmark will be displayed in the top left corner, if it's `false` it will be a forbidden icon and `undefined` will not render anything.

## `loading`

This prop will be inherited from the `Tiles` wrapper component. But if you use `Tile` as an individual component you can always set the `loading` state manually through this prop.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-tiles-tile--tile" />
</Canvas>

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
