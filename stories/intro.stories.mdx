# OneWelcome React Component Library

This project provides React components built according to the [UI Component Library design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/1f7161d7-5ade-4e54-bb3d-6e4aa3a1d1a0-4a22/grid/). It uses the [DTS tool](https://weiran-zsd.github.io/dts-cli/) which provides for a consistent setup and configuration.

Quickly build good looking, responsive and accessible UIs using our components and hooks.

# Installation

In order to install the component library into your React project, simply install it through NPM using:

```bash
npm install @onewelcome/react-lib-components
```

It is [publicly available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onewelcome/react-lib-components).

## Setup

To have all of the `CSS variables`, that are used throughout all of the components, working correctly, you need to wrap your entire application with our `BaseStyling` component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BaseStyling } from "@onewelcome/react-lib-components";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BaseStyling>
      {...any views you want to render here}
    </BaseStyling>
  );
}
```

## Fonts

By default the component library will use the `Red Hat Display` font family. [Please read the Typography documentation to understand how to install this font in your React project.](/docs/stories-ui-typography--typography).

## Icons

This component libary offers its own icons and `<Icon />` component. [Please see the Icon component documentation for further information.](/docs/stories-ui-icon--icon)

# Usage

Using our component library is easy. You can import any component (or hook) from `@onewelcome/react-lib-component`. All components' & hooks' names match their respective story name. An example of how you can import a `ContextMenu` component would be:

```jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "@onewelcome/react-lib-components";
```

Our library is created using Typescript, which means you have awesome autocomplete on the imports and props that you can pass to the component.

# Storybook

You have arrived on the Storybook component explorer for the component library. It will showcase all of the components and you can fully control them using the controls that Storybook provides.

You can select any component's Story in the sidebar on the left. There are different categories that provide you with different components.
Make sure to enable the different navigation components within Storybook:

- Press `S` to show/hide the sidebar.
- Press `T` to show/hide the toolbar.
- Press `A` to show/hide the addons (controls/actions/accessibility) (only available in `Canvas` mode).

If you'd like to know more about how to use Storybook, [you can check this webpage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/browse-stories).
