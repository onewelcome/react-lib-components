# OneWelcome React Component Library

This project provides React components built according to the [OneWelcome design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/1f7161d7-5ade-4e54-bb3d-6e4aa3a1d1a0-4a22/grid/).

Quickly build good-looking, responsive and accessible UIs using our components and hooks.

## Get started

In order to install the component library into your React project, simply install it through NPM using:

```bash
npm install @onewelcome/react-lib-components
```

The npm is [publicly available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onewelcome/react-lib-components).

## Setup

To have all of the `CSS variables`, that are used throughout all components, working correctly, you need to wrap your entire application with our `BaseStyling` component.

Read more information in the docs of the [BaseStyling component](/docs/components-layout-basestyling--page).

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BaseStyling } from "@onewelcome/react-lib-components";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BaseStyling>
      {...any views you want to render here}
    </BaseStyling>
  );
}
```

## Fonts

By default, the OneWelcome React Component Library will use the font `Red Hat Display`. Please read the Typography documentation to understand [how to install this font](/docs/components-data-display-typography--typography) in your React project.

## Icons

This component library offers its own icons and `<Icon />` component. Please see the [Icon component](/docs/components-data-display-icon--icon) documentation for further information.

## Usage

Using our component library is easy. You can import any component (or hook) from `@onewelcome/react-lib-component`. All components' & hooks' names match their respective story name. An example of how you can import a `ContextMenu` component would be:

```jsx
import { ContextMenu } from "@onewelcome/react-lib-components";
```

Our library is created using Typescript, which means you have awesome autocomplete on the imports and props that you can pass to the component.

## Storybook

You have arrived at the Storybook component explorer for the component library. It will showcase all components, and you can fully control them using the controls that Storybook provides.

You can select any component's Story in the sidebar on the left. There are different categories that provide you with different components.
Make sure to enable the different navigation components within Storybook:

- Press `S` to show/hide the sidebar.
- Press `T` to show/hide the toolbar.
- Press `A` to show/hide the addons (controls/actions/accessibility) (only available in `Canvas` mode).

On the Storybook website you can read more [how to use Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/browse-stories).
