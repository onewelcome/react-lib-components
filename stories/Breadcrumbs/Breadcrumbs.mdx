<Title />
<Subtitle />

The breadcrumbs component exists to give you easily formatted navigation links to put in your application. It accepts
`children`, which should be only `<Link />` components. The last `<Link />` component that you pass will automatically
be converted to a normal `<Typography />` element since we don't need the current page you're on to be clickable.

## Accessibility

For accessibility reasons, an `ariaLabel` prop is mandatory. This is because, by default, screenreaders will not know if a `nav` element
is used as a menu, or other purpose. You should pass the translation of `breadcrumbs` in the active language to this prop.

# Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story id="stories-ui-breadcrumbs--breadcrumbs" />
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Breadcrumbs ariaLabel="breadcrumbs">
  <Link key="1" to="#">
    Home
  </Link>
  <Link key="2" to="#invoice">
    Invoices
  </Link>
  <Link key="3" to="#invoice/123-456-789">
    Invoice #01/02/1990
  </Link>
  <Link key="4" to="#invoice/123-456-789/tax">
    Tax liabilities
  </Link>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

# Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
