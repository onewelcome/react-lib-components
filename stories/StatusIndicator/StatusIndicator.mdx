`StatusIndicator` component is used to display a status badge along the status text.
It accepts a `status` prop, which can be used to change the badge's color and a `badgeClassName`, which can be used to style the status badge.
`StatusIndicator` uses a `Typography` component to display the status text - `typographyProps` prop can be used to adjust that component to your liking.
